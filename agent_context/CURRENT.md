## Real-data training runner (added 2026-08-22)

`scripts/run_governed_ridge_training.py` is the first production caller of the governed training
stack. Until it existed, `run_persisted_ridge_trial()`
(`src/quant_system/modeling/training_evidence.py:131`) had no caller outside tests — the stack was
implemented, tested, and unreachable. The runner chains real Upstox acquisition ->
`build_feature_dataset` -> `build_label_dataset` -> `build_purged_fold` ->
`run_persisted_ridge_trial` -> `EvidenceStore`. It imports no data generator, so it has no synthetic
fallback to take.

Status by stage. **All seven stages have now executed on real market data.**

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Real Upstox acquisition | **PROVEN** | **498 real daily bars** for `NSE_EQ\|INE009A01021` (INFY), 2024-01-01..2025-12-31 |
| 2. Session calendar | PROVEN on the provider-derived path | 498 sessions derived from the exchange dates actually returned |
| 3. Governed re-acquisition | **PROVEN** | 498 bars, `status=ACCEPTED`, `source_status=COMPLETE` |
| 4. `build_feature_dataset` | **PROVEN** | 478 feature rows |
| 5. `build_label_dataset` | **PROVEN** | 476 label rows; real NSE statutory costs, 0.224% round trip |
| 6. `build_purged_fold` | **PROVEN** | train=411, validation=63, embargo=2 |
| 7. `run_persisted_ridge_trial` | **PROVEN — both paths** | Trials 1-2 published a terminal `FAILED` outcome (`DEGENERATE_RETURN_SERIES`); trial 3 published `SUCCEEDED` with full model evidence |

### Three trials. The model trains, and it loses money.

| Trial | Ordinal | Threshold | Validation | Outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `trial_real_001` | 1 | `0` | 8 | `FAILED` — `DEGENERATE_RETURN_SERIES` |
| `trial_real_002` | 2 | `0` | 63 | `FAILED` — `DEGENERATE_RETURN_SERIES` |
| `trial_real_003` | 3 | `-0.1144` | 63 | **`SUCCEEDED`** — model evidence published |

Trial 3 result, `model_06ae80823d3b66ac8405b9eb`, 315 attributable decision records,
`verdict=RESEARCH_ONLY`, `multiplicity_count=3`:

| Strategy | Sharpe | Accuracy | Trades | Max DD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **RIDGE (the candidate)** | **-0.704** | 0.524 | 22 | 0.060 |
| NO_TRADE | 0.000 | 0.587 | 0 | 0.000 |
| BUY_AND_HOLD | -0.547 | 0.413 | 63 | 0.068 |
| PREVIOUS_SIGN | **+0.144** | 0.556 | 26 | 0.064 |
| EQUITY_DUAL_MOMENTUM | -3.684 | 0.397 | 42 | 0.139 |

**The candidate is the second-worst strategy on the board.** Its Sharpe is negative. It is beaten by
doing nothing, by buy-and-hold, and by a trivial repeat-the-previous-sign rule — the only baseline
with a positive Sharpe. Its 52.4% accuracy is below the 58.7% obtained by never trading: it trades
22 times and destroys value doing so.

`deflated_sharpe_ratio = 0.120566231116`. **This is a probability, not a Sharpe** — the
multiplicity- and sampling-adjusted probability that the true Sharpe beats the selection benchmark,
deflated against all three attempts. `GatePolicyV1.min_deflated_sharpe` defaults to `0.95`, so this
fails `GATE_DEFLATED_SHARPE` by a wide margin. Nothing here is promotable and the machinery reports
that itself.

**Honest reading: this six-feature ridge has no edge on INFY over 2024-2025 after real statutory
costs.** Trials 1-2 could not measure that because the candidate never traded; trial 3 made it
legible. The threshold change bought a measurable result, not a good one — the same underlying
finding either way.

Caveat that must travel with these numbers: the trial-3 threshold `-0.1144` was chosen as the
training-partition mean target (train-only information, consistent with train-only preprocessing),
but it was chosen **after** the trial-1/2 diagnostic had already revealed the validation score
distribution. It is an informed choice, not a blind one. That is precisely why it carries ordinal 3
and deflates against three attempts. Do not sweep further thresholds hoping for a publishable
number; a fourth attempt inherits ordinal 4 and a harsher deflation, and the evidence above does not
suggest one is warranted.

Root cause of the trials 1-2 degeneracy, measured rather than inferred:

- Targets are encoded UP `+1.0` / DOWN `-1.0` (`modeling/ridge.py:93`).
- The real label balance is 182 UP / 229 DOWN in the training partition, so the mean target is
  `-0.1144` and the fitted ridge intercept is `-0.114355` — they agree to five decimals.
- Validation scores over 63 sessions span `[-0.243, -0.026]`, mean `-0.140`, stdev `0.053`. The
  **maximum score is still below the `score_threshold=0`**, so the candidate predicts UP zero times
  out of 63 and takes no position at all.
- `_portfolio_period_returns` (`modeling/validation.py:402`) only records a return where
  `predicted_target == "UP"`, so every validation period is exactly `0.0`, variance is zero, and the
  deflated Sharpe is undefined.

This is **not a defect in the runner and not a defect in the model**. It is the guard behaving as
documented: it refuses to publish a probability of 0.5 for a candidate that never traded, which
would otherwise rank a do-nothing model above every genuinely losing one.

Two limitations are stated rather than resolved. The session calendar, absent `--calendar-file`, is
derived from provider data, so a provider that silently omits a trading day yields a calendar
agreeing with its own gap. The default universe is the single requested instrument — content-bound
and honest, but a stated universe, not a point-in-time membership authority, so it does nothing
about survivorship bias.

## Open program-level majors

1. Protected remote / CI integration in progress.
2. Legacy Code Craft/Test Craft baseline findings remain even though Ruff and strict Mypy are green.
3. No clean-build or artifact-to-source provenance proof.
4. Product capability claims exceed implemented live-execution behavior.

## Reference development machine

- ASUS Vivobook 14 X1407QA, Windows 11 ARM64.
- Snapdragon X X1-26-100, 8 cores/8 threads, approximately 3.0 GHz.
- 16 GB LPDDR5X-8448 RAM; 512 GB WD NVMe SSD.
- Current QuantOS virtual environment: CPython 3.13.15.

## Next safe actions

1. Clone and sync on the remote development machine using `START_HERE.md`.
2. Proceed with Slice 4 implementation (One Governed Ridge Fold) following `.launch/SLICES.md`.
3. Do **not** run a fourth threshold on INFY 2024-2025. Three ordinals are spent and the candidate
   posts a negative Sharpe beaten by doing nothing; further sweeps are multiplicity spend against
   evidence that already points one way. If the ridge family is to be pursued, change something
   real — instrument, universe breadth, horizon, or feature set — and treat it as a new campaign.
4. Independent adjudication of the runner and these results has **not** occurred. No Red Team pass,
   no clean-clone Verifier pass. `verdict=RESEARCH_ONLY` is the model's own label, not a
   certification.
4. Reconcile the stale sections at the top of this file against `.launch/STATE.md` (coordinator).
